# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Breakout ("smth" version)


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
Recreating the Breakout Arcade game with some of our own unique twists.



## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Our software will create a visual element that showcases the game through a visual interface. Out software will ensure that the game runs smoothly through creating an interactive game that uses moving objects. Features: color, sound effects, moving platform and balls, powerups, etc. It will be executed through python or pygames or whatever visual interface we decide to use.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

not applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Katerina Papamichail (me): tur63121@temple.edu, Yihan Zhang
Sivhour Le: sivhour.le@temple.edu, Elmira Talebianaraki
Anastasiia Chystukh: tut14634@temple.edu, Daniel Blitshtein

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The game should operate in a way that a player can move the platform to hit the balls at the very least. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A great outcome would be the player moving up levels and adding interesting features to the game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome is a very sleek game that works perfectly well with no glitches and a smooth progression from level to level and many power up features and modifications to the Breakout game.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will learn how to use Github and through teamwork, create a game and learn how to divvy up work. We also need to learn a new library such as pygame which is different from python. We will learn how to use visuals in computer science in conjunction with code. We will need to research Breakout the game itself to learn how it is run. We will also need to research new libraries, commands, and learn more about python. When working with multiple classmates, we will decide to divvy up the work once we have started on a more concrete idea and learned exactly what needs to be done. We could also separate different components such as moving the ball, moving the platform, creating the visual interface, etc.
